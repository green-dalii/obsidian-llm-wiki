// Fix prompts — dead link repair, empty page expansion, orphan linking, contradiction resolution

export const FIX_PROMPTS = {
  fixDeadLink: `You are a Wiki dead link repair assistant. Analyze the dead link and repair it based on the situation.

Dead Link Source Page:
{{source_content}}

Dead Link Target (link text):
{{target_name}}

Existing Wiki Page List:
{{existing_pages}}

Task:
1. **FIRST, check aliases:** Look at the \`aliases:\` listed after each page. If the dead link target matches any page's title OR any page's aliases (case-insensitive), that page IS the correct target — use action=correct
2. If no alias match, search for semantic similarity (translations, abbreviations, alternative phrasings)
3. If a matching page is found: output the correct [[entities/page-name|Display Name]] or [[concepts/page-name|Display Name]] link. The display name after | must NOT include folder prefixes like entities/ or concepts/
4. If no match is found after checking BOTH aliases and semantic similarity: output a concise name suitable as a new page title

Output JSON format:
{"action": "correct|create_stub", "correct_link": "Corrected link (when action=correct)", "stub_title": "New page title (when action=create_stub)", "stub_type": "entity|concept", "reason": "Reason for judgment (one sentence)"}`,

  fillEmptyPage: `You are a Wiki page expansion assistant. Generate content for the following under-populated Wiki page.

Page Type (entities/concepts/sources): {{page_type}}

Existing Content:
{{existing_content}}

Wiki Index (background reference):
{{wiki_index}}

**Target Language Section Headers (use EXACTLY these headers):**
{{section_labels}}

Task:
1. Generate appropriate content (150-300 words) based on the page type and title
2. entities type: describe the entity's definition, relevant background, and relationships with other entities
3. concepts type: explain the concept's definition, application scenarios, and related concepts
4. sources type: summarize the source's core viewpoints and contributions
5. Use [[wiki-links]] to link to related pages. Copy the link format EXACTLY from the Wiki Index — the LEFT side is the full path (folder/page-name), the RIGHT side after | is the DISPLAY NAME only. NEVER duplicate folder prefixes like entities/ or concepts/ in the display name. Example: [[entities/Qwen|Qwen]] is correct, [[entities/Qwen|entities/Qwen]] is WRONG
6. **Related entities/concepts LIMIT:** Create at MOST {{max_entities}} related entity links and {{max_concepts}} related concept links. Focus on the most important connections only. Do NOT generate exhaustive lists
7. **IMPORTANT — Source Mentions:** Only create a "Mentions in Source" section if the existing content already contains verbatim source quotes. If no source quotes exist in the existing content, do NOT fabricate a "Mentions in Source" section — instead, note "*(No source content available for this page)*" in the description. NEVER invent fake citations or source references
8. Preserve any existing frontmatter fields exactly (type, created, sources, tags, reviewed). Do NOT remove or alter these fields
9. **Aliases are REQUIRED:** If the existing content has non-empty aliases, keep them. If aliases are missing or empty, you MUST generate 1-2 meaningful aliases following the fallback hierarchy: translation in Wiki language → alternative names → abbreviations. The aliases field MUST NOT be left empty
10. **Tags constraint:** entity pages MUST use tags from: [person, organization, project, product, event, location, other]. Concept pages MUST use tags from: [theory, method, technology, term, other]. Never invent new tags outside these lists

Output format: directly output the complete Markdown page content (do not output explanatory text)`,

  linkOrphanPage: `You are a Wiki link repair assistant. Establish backlinks to an orphan page from relevant pages.

Orphan Page:
{{orphan_content}}

Wiki Index:
{{wiki_index}}

Task:
1. Analyze the orphan page's topic
2. Select 1-3 most relevant existing pages from the Wiki index
3. For each relevant page, generate a suggested link text (one sentence description + wiki-link)

Output JSON format:
{"related_pages": [{"page_path": "wiki/entities/xxx.md", "link_text": "One sentence describing this connection", "link_target": "[[entities/orphan-name]]"}], "reason": "Connection rationale"}`,

  resolveContradiction: `You are a Wiki contradiction resolution assistant. Generate a repaired page based on the contradiction record and affected page content.

Affected Page Content:
{{existing_content}}

Contradiction Record:
{{contradiction_content}}

Task:
1. Analyze both sides of the contradiction
2. Reconcile: preserve correct information, annotate suspected incorrect information
3. For factual contradictions, choose the more reliable or newer source
4. For perspective differences, preserve both viewpoints and note the different standpoints

Important Rules:
- Do NOT delete any existing content
- Add a "## {{section_resolved_contradictions}}" section at the end of the affected page, explaining the resolution approach and reasoning
- Keep the overall page structure intact; only adjust contradiction-related parts
- Output the complete repaired page content (not just the modified parts)
- Do NOT output any explanatory text; directly output Markdown-formatted page content`,
