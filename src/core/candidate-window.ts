// core/candidate-window.ts — the one ranked window every prompt draws from
// when it shows the model a list of "existing pages".
//
// Until now each call site built that list on its own, and two of them bounded
// it blindly. The semantic dedup fell back to the FULL same-type list whenever
// the candidate's name shared no token with any title (61 % of entity trials
// on a 2,800-page vault), and Fix Dead Links took every page in vault
// iteration order and cut the rendered text at 3,000 characters. Measured at a
// local 26B model: the full list contained the target by construction and the
// model found it 0 of 18 times; a 30-entry window that contained the target,
// 9 of 9. So the question is not "cap or no cap" but WHICH RANKING puts the
// target into K slots without a model call.
//
// The answer measured over 1,585 hidden-alias trials (every curated alias of
// every page hidden in turn, the item described by the note it came from):
// ranking on the page's own prose, not only on title and aliases, moves the
// target into the window in 42 % of trials against 25 % for the shipped name
// gate; on ten hand-picked synonym cases 2 of 10 became 7 of 10.
//
// Score per page = lexical (title 3 / alias 2 per query token, the existing
// `localKeywordMatch`) + 1 per context keyword found in the page's prose.
// Keywords that occur in more than CANDIDATE_WINDOW_DF_CAP of the pool's pages
// are dropped before scoring: on any vault those are the function words of its
// language, so the cap replaces a language-specific stop list. Ties keep pool
// order, so a caller's ordering (ctime, for the KV-prefix cache) survives
// among equals. The window is always K pages, or the whole pool when it is
// smaller: pages without any signal fill the tail in pool order instead of
// triggering a list the model cannot use.
//
// What this does not reach: a target whose title, aliases and prose share
// nothing with the item — a page written in another script, an initialism
// whose expansion the page never spells out. The full list did not reach it
// either (0 of 18 above); it only looked as if it did.
