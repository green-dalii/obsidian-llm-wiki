// Issue #364 — folder-boundary scoping for "ingest a folder".
//
// A bare `path.startsWith(folder.path)` treats a folder path as a plain string
// prefix, which is not the same as "is a descendant of this folder". Two things
// leak through:
//
//   * sibling folders sharing a name prefix — picking "Notizen" also matches
//     "Notizen-temp/x.md", because "Notizen-temp/x.md".startsWith("Notizen")
//   * a file sitting next to the folder — "Notizen.md" also matches "Notizen"
//
// Anchoring on a trailing slash makes the comparison mean what the caller
// intends. The vault root is the one folder with no prefix: every path is a
// descendant of it, and its own `path` is "/" rather than "".
//
// Pure and IO-free so the boundary rule can be unit-tested without an Obsidian
// vault — the call site only supplies two primitives.

/**
 * The string prefix every descendant of a folder shares.
 * Returns '' for the vault root, so `startsWith` accepts every path.

 * Issue #502 — the folder picker applies `isExcludedFromSourcePicker` to the
 * folders it offers, which hides `wiki/`. It also offers the vault root, and
 * root scope accepts every path, so choosing the root put `wiki/` back: the
 * plugin ingested its own generated pages as source material. Both halves are
 * deliberate and separately tested; only their composition was missing a rule.
 *
 * The two file pickers (`FileSuggestModal`, `MultiFileSuggestModal`) already
