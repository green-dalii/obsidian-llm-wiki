// task-policy.ts — per-step choice of wire output mode and thinking.
//
// Issue #481 established that on an openai-compatible wire the two are not
// independent: a `response_format` on the request sets `reasoning_tokens` to
// 0 regardless of `reasoning_effort`, `disableThinking`, or the server's own
// switch. "Let this step think" is therefore not a flag but a decision about
// the output mode, and it can only be made per step — the pipeline's schema
// callers (extract, lemma-classify, merge-triage, the dedup pair) and its
// prose callers (page-generate, source-page, merge-body, related-page,
// complementary, pdf-convert) want opposite things from the same setting.
//
// Which of them benefits from reasoning is unmeasured. This module exists so
// that it can be measured: an arm of a comparison run is a policy string, not
// a patch and a rebuild.
//
// Default is "change nothing" for every step except the two named in
// `BUILTIN_TASK_POLICIES` (Issue #524): an unset policy resolves to `default`
// on both axes, which means the OutputModeProber picks the mode exactly as
// before and the caller's own `enableThinking` argument is passed through
// untouched. `src/__tests__/core/task-policy.test.ts` pins that.

 * with a `response_format` on the wire, `on` is overruled by the schema
 * (#481), which is precisely why the two axes are set together here.
 *
 * `low` / `medium` / `high` are `on` with a budget — they send
 * `reasoning_effort` at that level. The distinction earns its place: measured
 * on gemma-4-26b, unbounded thinking at the extraction step consumed all
 * 16000 tokens of the batch budget and returned nothing, twice. "Thinking
 * helps here" and "thinking fits here" are different questions, and only the
 * bounded levels can ask the first one.

 * one long-output generative step and leaves the short judgement calls
 * (lemma-classify, merge-triage, the dedup pair) on the prober's default.
 *
 * Thinking stays `default` on purpose: the call site's `disableThinking`
 * argument passes through exactly as it did before 1.26.3. A user entry for
