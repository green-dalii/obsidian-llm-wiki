// Issue #305: surface *why* the provider stopped generating.
//
// An OpenAI-compatible provider does not throw when it hits the token limit.
// It returns HTTP 200 and a body that stops mid-token, so a caller that only
// sees the response text cannot distinguish "the model finished" from "the
// model was cut off". The AI SDK already normalizes this into
// `result.finishReason`; every client here simply dropped it on `return
// result.text`. These helpers carry it to callers that opt in.

 * A thinking-capable model whose runtime ignores the thinking-disable control
 * spends its budget in the reasoning channel and returns empty visible
 * content at `finish_reason: length`. On the wire that is a 200, so without
 * this the caller sees a generic parse failure and goes looking for a bad
 * prompt — the exact wrong place.
 *
 * Two deliberate narrowings against the v1.19.0 predicate:
 *
 *   - `text` is the text the caller is about to receive, AFTER the
 *     reasoning-channel prepend (`prependReasoningForParse`). LMStudio +
 *     Qwen3.5 routes valid structured output into `reasoning_content` with
 *     empty visible content; that call succeeded and must not throw here.
 *   - An absent `reasoningTokens` never fires. The predicate needs the
 *     provider to have said what the tokens went to; without it, "empty at
 *     length" is just truncation, which is #305's signal, not this one.
